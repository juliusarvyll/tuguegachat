# Multi-Person Chat Room Strategy

## Hybrid Approach: Smart Room System

### 1. **Dynamic Popular Rooms**
- Create rooms automatically when 3+ users are waiting for group chat
- Rooms auto-dissolve when empty for 10+ minutes
- School-based room preferences (users from same school grouped first)

### 2. **Featured Topic Rooms** (Pre-made)
- 3-5 curated rooms with broad appeal:
  - "Study Buddies" 
  - "Random Chat"
  - "Gaming Corner"
  - "Help & Support"
- Only show rooms with 1+ active users

### 3. **Smart Room Suggestions**
```typescript
interface RoomSuggestion {
  id: string
  name: string
  type: 'dynamic' | 'featured' | 'school-based'
  activeUsers: number
  maxUsers: number
  tags?: string[]
  schoolId?: string
}
```

### 4. **Implementation Strategy**

#### Phase 1: Simple Pre-made Rooms
- Start with 3 featured rooms
- Show active user count
- Hide empty rooms

#### Phase 2: Dynamic Room Creation  
- Auto-create school-based rooms when needed
- Implement room lifecycle management

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- User-created temporary rooms
- Interest-based matching
- Room recommendations

### 5. **User Experience Flow**
1. User selects "Group Chat"
2. Show available rooms with user counts
3. If no good options, offer to "Start New Room" or "Wait for Others"
4. Auto-match users who choose "Wait for Others"

### 6. **Technical Considerations**
- Room state management in Supabase
- Real-time user count updates
- Room cleanup jobs
- Scalable presence tracking

## Recommendation
Start with **3-4 pre-made featured rooms** and monitor usage patterns. This gives immediate value while we gather data on user preferences for future dynamic features.
